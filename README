2. Abstract: The dataset collects data from a wearable accelerometer mounted on the chest. Uncalibrated Accelerometer Data are collected from 15 participants performing 7 activities. The dataset is intended for Activity Recognition research purposes. It provides challenges for identification and authentication of people using motion patterns.

3. Relevant Information:
   --- The dataset collects data from a wearable accelerometer mounted on the chest
   --- Sampling frequency of the accelerometer: 52 Hz
   --- Accelerometer Data are Uncalibrated
   --- Number of Participants: 15
   --- Number of Activities: 7
   --- Data Format: CSV

4. Dataset Information
   --- Data are separated by participant
   --- Each file contains the following information
       ---- sequential number, x acceleration, y acceleration, z acceleration, label 
   --- Labels are codified by numbers
       --- 1: Working at Computer
       --- 2: Standing Up, Walking and Going up\down stairs
       --- 3: Standing
       --- 4: Walking
       --- 5: Going Up\Down Stairs
       --- 6: Walking and Talking with Someone
       --- 7: Talking while Standing
       
5. Discovery

   ---Label = 0 means the end of all of motions.
      --- maybe label = 0 is a undefined action
   ---Can we split data by sexual? maybe by hierarchical
   ---Can we say that data is collectd by every time the person open the device
   ---the data is collected by a continuous time or by the device manually opened 
   ---In out team work, we use xyz diff moving average and standard deviation by 52 points, 
         we can get the accuracy = 0.98, it is incredible, but we only get a value then the model 
         can tell that this value is like motion 1. We didn't use any series information ,but get            this high comeback. It is unreal. 

6. Idea
   ---using mean and standard deviation to split plot
      ---plot is done, need more ideas
   ---Can we say that data is collectd by every time the person open the device
      ---still need to check
   ---how to classification just two motion by the same person
      ---
   ---using shiny to plot 
      ---It's fun
   ---can I use sequential test to test a series motion data is which kind of motion
      ---need to survey more
   ---take 1000 points , micro vs macro
      ---done, we can see by change range
   ---test motion2 can separate to 3 part and from other momtion data 
      ---
   ---take every motion the first/last 2 seconds , if they are the same?
      ---I take the first/last 2 seconds and do the anova test , result is each person are the same.
      ---moreover do the pairwises test to check which two are most different
      ---hope that we can get more information by doing pairwise t-test.
   ---using decision tree to make predictions, maybe we can get the better accuracy by using random forest , but we can't explan th e resul well.

9. Result
   ---Accuracy 0.98 by random forest
   	--- It's incredible to get the score for this data, because I thought this dataset is very difficult to understand at first.
	--- only take moving average, moving standard deviation, moving median to get this accuracy.
